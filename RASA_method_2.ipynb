Associated Press (AP) recreated what happened inside the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theatre, which had served as the bombarded Ukrainian city’s main bomb shelter for more than a week before being hit on March 16, from the accounts of 23 survivors, rescuers, and people intimately familiar with the building’s new purpose.It drew on two sets of floor plans of the venue, photographs and video taken inside before, during and after that day, and feedback from experts who reviewed the methodology.With communications severed, people coming and going constantly and memories blurred by trauma, an exact toll is impossible to determine.The government estimated early on that around 300 people died and has since opened a war crimes investigation, according to a document obtained by the AP.AP journalists arrived at a much higher number through the reconstruction of a 3D model of the building reviewed repeatedly by direct witnesses, most from within the theatre, who described in detail where people were sheltering.All said at least 100 people were at a field kitchen just outside, and none survived.They also said the rooms and hallways inside the building were packed, with about one person for every three square metres of free space.Many survivors estimated around 1,000 people were inside at the time of the airstrike, but the most anyone saw escape, including rescuers, was around 200.The survivors primarily left through the main exit or one side entrance; the other side and the back were crushed.The AP investigation also refutes Russian claims that the theatre was demolished by Ukrainian forces or served as a Ukrainian military base.None of the witnesses saw Ukrainian soldiers operating inside the building.And not one person doubted that the theatre was destroyed in a Russian air attack aimed with precision at a civilian target everyone knew was the city’s largest bomb shelter, with children in it.But the questions remain: how many bodies are there and what happened to them?A police officer who passed the theatre a week after the airstrike said the smell of death was overpowering.He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he still has relatives in Russia-controlled territory.Video taken by Russian state media shows no bodies inside, contrary to the descriptions of multiple witnesses.The lack of bodies led the police officer and a Mariupol Red Cross official to speculate that perhaps fewer than 500 people died, but most survivors suggested the bodies were either pulverised into the dust or removed by the Russians.With the site off-limits to investigators and the rubble itself taken away, witness testimony and photos and video of the theatre before and after it was bombed will be crucial, said Clint Williamson, who served as US ambassador-at-large for war crimes issues from 2006 to 2009.“Without being able to get to the scene, it is going to be difficult to go much beyond that,” he said.The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe has declared the attack on the Mariupol drama theatre an “egregious violation” of international humanitarian law.The organisation’s mid-April report found that “those who ordered or executed it committed a war crime”.It also found no dispute that the destruction of the theatre was deliberate.This finding was echoed by two munitions experts interviewed by the AP, who said the scope of the destruction points to a 500kg bomb from a Russian warplane.“It’s much too much for an artillery shell,” said Mark Cancian, an explosives analyst at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies and a former artillery officer.“The fact that it hit square on would lead me to believe that’s what they were aiming at.”Russian troops want to take over Mariupol because of its strategic value as a port and a link between territories in the south and east held by Russia-friendly forces.Moscow has declared victory but Ukraine refuses to acknowledge defeat.', 'intent':
